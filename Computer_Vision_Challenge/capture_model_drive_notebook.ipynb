    "# Autonomous Driving Car (Trackmania)\n",
    "- This project aims to develop an autonomous driving model that can navigate a racing game environment by predicting directional commands based on real-time screen captures. The approach combines data collection, supervised learning, and computer vision techniques to train a model that classifies actions (up, down, left, and right) and performs them based on the game’s visual inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Project Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Collection: A script captures in-game frames with associated keypresses, creating a structured dataset by categorizing frames into folders for each action. This dataset forms the foundation for training the model.\n",
    "- Model Development: Using the FastAI library, we explored different versions of ResNet (e.g., ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50) with pre-trained and non-pre-trained weights, dropout regularization, and advanced techniques like differential learning rates, mixed precision, and one-cycle learning.\n",
    "- Real-Time Driving: The final script utilizes the trained model to predict actions in real time, capturing screen inputs and performing actions in response.\n",
    "- Challenges: Throughout development, we faced several key challenges, particularly in improving turn predictions (left/right) despite high accuracy metrics. Extensive experimentation with various architectures and training techniques was required to optimize the model's performance."

    "- This captures game frames in real-time and logs the key presses (up, down, left, right) with timestamps and simulated speed data. Each key-press frame is saved to a designated folder based on the action, creating a structured dataset for training.\n",

    "**Challenges:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensuring data accuracy, as capturing precise, labeled game actions required balancing frame rate and keypress timing.\n",
